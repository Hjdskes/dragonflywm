DragonflyWM
============================
DragonflyWM is a nimble, fast and modern tiling window manager for X, based on MonsterWM.

Its goal is to be (somewhat) EWMH compliant, whilst staying lightweight. Currently, DragonflyWM supports third party panels, pagers and window switchers. Some of this is rudimentary, but as the project matures support will be improved. On the [TODO][todo] list is support for minimizing and restoring clients, but there are a few other non-EWMH items that will be implemented first.

Feel free to check out the [TODO][todo] list and help out if you like the project!
