to implement:
  *net_wm_state_demands_attention for skype (qt in general) focusurgent
  *nmaster
  *per desktop mfact

bugs:
  *when closing last running application, client list does not get updated
  *libreoffice splash crashes the wm
  *net_wm_window_type_dock : tooltips appear behind clients. XRaiseWindow initially works. Something permanent?
  *panels do not see netwmdemandsattention urgent hints
  *machinebacon: we open two frames, one gets focus, we click into the other one, it gets focus but doesn't receive input (the input goes to the previous frame). So one has to click into the anyway active frame, then into the other one, and then it works. 

check / cleanup:
  *netclientlist : improve c->desk
  *setdesktopnames : cleanup
  *general code commenting and cleanup
  *more calls to change clientstate?
  *fix compile warnings

next release:
  *make client appear on all desktops
  *minimizing/restoring clients
  *give non-resizeable clients their own (requested) position
      skype splash
  *honor transient hints on e.g. about dialogs
  *move applications around in panel
  *look into why window rules behave differently from DWM
