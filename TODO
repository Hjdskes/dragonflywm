  *togglepanel bug
  *uselessgap multiple clients vs one client -> panel

  *net_wm_window_type_dock : tooltips appear behind clients. XRaiseWindow initially works. Something permanent? only with tint2?
  *panels do not see netwmdemandsattention urgent hints
  *machinebacon: we open two frames, one gets focus, we click into the other one,
   it gets focus but doesn't receive input (the input goes to the previous frame).
   So one has to click into the anyway active frame, then into the other one, and then it works. gcolor3 

check / cleanup:
  *setdesktopnames : cleanup
  *general code commenting and cleanup
  *more calls to change clientstate?
  *properly implement DESKTOPS
  *rework stackÂ² layout with c->x?
  *fix int vs unsigned int
  *clean up code for next commit

next release:
  *combine both desktop arrays?
  *improve setup atoms?
  *make client appear on all desktops
  *minimizing/restoring clients
  *honor transient hints on e.g. about dialogs
  *move applications around in panel
  *change all layouts to something like DWM?
